# Hearts of Iron 4 Image Extractor
Very simple program to extract images specified by Hearts of Iron 4 .gfx files from their .dds format into a more usable .png and organize them into a more readable webpage.



Not very useable by running in the IDE, if you want to build it yourself, compiling it through the ant script will copy all the requisite files to the right place in the dist folder.
